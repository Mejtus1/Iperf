üö® What This Tells You
‚úÖ Your Network Can "Theoretically" Push ~120 Mbps
At best moments, you reached 120 Mbps, which is your upper hardware/driver/wireless link capability.

The average sustained rate ended up being ~82 Mbps.

BUT‚Ä¶

‚ùå You're Dropping Packets Like Crazy (69% LOSS)
UDP has no congestion control, so you're sending more than your network can handle ‚Üí flood = packet drop.

This is a clear sign that your Wi-Fi or router chokes under high datagram rate.

üÜö Compared to TCP
In TCP:

You got ~52 Mbps reliably.

TCP controls speed using ACKs and windows, preventing overflood.

Hence, TCP is lower but stable and realistic.

In UDP:

You pushed way beyond limits.

But dropped 2 out of 3 packets.

So, it's not sustainable for apps that need reliability (e.g., video conferencing, VoIP).

üìå TL;DR: What You Just Discovered
Metric	Value
Stable TCP rate	~52 Mbps
UDP Max Burst	~120 Mbps
UDP Avg	~82 Mbps
Packet Loss	69% (üü• very high)
Conclusion	Your network‚Äôs real usable capacity is about 50‚Äì60 Mbps on Wi-Fi. You can technically push more ‚Äî but not without chaos.
